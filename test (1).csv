"The product was of considerable quality, well built and structurally sound. This tip was purchased for my sons 600GSXR. It did take some modification to attach, which if you have any mechanical ability, shouldn’t  be too hard to figure out. It would have been 5 stars if it was a little simpler to attach. Not a problem for me, but possibly for some if they are expecting a two minute bolt on part.",9,positive

"Comparing this to my friend's Pedal Commander which he just installed before Christmas, I received a used unit. The box was open and unsealed. Missing were the velcro, decal, prep wipe, bracket, and lanyard. Not sure if a separate instruction sheet is included or not. The unit itself seemed intact but I had no way to mount it. No idea if the issue lies within Pedal Commander or Amazon. Regardless, it went back for a refund. Be sure to check your box for all contents.",9,positive
"These are a nice, affordable alternative to the expensive OEM cross bars, and they fit and look great on my 2019 Rav4. I wanted cross bars when I bought the car, but I could not bring myself to pay the OEM price. I'm glad to have these at the ready when I need them.<br /><br />Installation was simple. When installing, do not tighten the screws that affix the cross-bars to the mounts until after you have affixed and tightened the mounts to the car. This is mentioned in the instructions, but I think it's worth calling out here. In fact, leave them fairly loose. To minimize tightening with the allen wrench on my second bar (rear), I left them only slightly loose...a half-turn or so from tight...but enough that the mounts could slide if needed...or so I thought. I ended up having to loosen the screws several turns to allow the mounts to slide in/out without binding in order to fit the mounts to the car.<br /><br />Another tip is that, if you cannot turn the lock when installing the mount covers, press down where the cover affixes to the bar, as well as where the cover affixes to the mount, fore and aft of the bar. Those areas will snap in to place, and the lock will turn freely only when all contact areas are properly affixed.<br /><br />I think the only con is that the labels applied to identify Left-Right and Front-Back items do not come off cleanly from the plastic mount covers. To remove the remaining residue, simply used some packing tape. Press the tape onto the residue and remove it quickly. Sticky removes sticky. After a few pulls, the residue should come off of the plastic and stick to the tape. No stars off for this minor inconvenience. The labels come off cleanly from the metal mounts and bars.",9,positive

"very well made with cloth flaps, not cheap sponge like some other over priced buffs. These have lasted through several wheel cleanings and are still looking serviceable for quite a FEW MORE wheel polish sessions.  Fully washable and ready to use again after they dry. Even the shaft (which is sturdy and will not bend) has a plastic or vinyl sleeve protecting it, should you slip with the buff on your drill. How clever is that?  It is a bit pricey, but I think you'll be using it far longer then those other sponge type brands.  This makes short work of buffing out rain/debris spots on your chrome or polished wheels quick and wasy so you can go ride.  I wish it was a bit less expensive, but I'm glad it's not made cheap. And I can't think of one that's made or performs better.",3,positive

"Overpriced, and other issues…<br />I am a certified aromatherapist, so I jump at the chance to test interesting units.  Technically this is not a diffuser, it’s a nebulizer. It uses no water. Instead the essential oil is dispersed out in teeny mist particles into the air. Many companies will also call this a waterless diffuser. So for the sake of simplicity, I will continue to call it a diffuser.<br />It is the standard size of a soda can, and will fit nicely into your cupholder. It is cordless, and quickly re-charges. It has held charges for me for multiple diffusing sessions. It is completely silent. And it holds a fair amount of essential oil, which might be a good thing or a bad thing.<br />That’s about all I like about it.<br /> I’ll start off by qualifying that I have this complaint with every one of these units I’ve tested. When you diffuse from these waterless units, you are diffusing pure essential oil. As a result, the scent is much clearer, but you also use much much less.  The way these units are designed, you are likely to over diffuse. If you’re using an oil like Neroli, that could give you one heck of a headache.<br />It was the most difficult diffuser to refill. It doesn’t use the standard 10 or 15 ML bottle. So it holds a lot more essential oil, but for those of us used to using those nebulizers, that requires so much less oil, that bottle is too big for many of the oils I would want to disperse, and I think it would be exposed to too much oxygen.<br />Every other diffuser like this that I’ve tried needed nothing more than a finger push to get out the bottle. This you have to unscrew and re-screw and I just didn’t like it.  As far as performance, it was no better or worse than any of the other units that I’ve tried. I will warn you, that if you use essential oils like heavy resin‘s or thick oil‘s or sticky oil‘s you’re likely to clog the unit.  So don’t do it. Or at least make sure that it is well blended with a really thin oil like a citrus before you start. And if you dare to use one of those questionable oils, use only a drop or two.<br />The price… Out of control. I have tested multiple units of this nature and size and function. And the prices have range to $39-$49. I don’t see anything that makes this unit worth $79. Possibly they’re justifying the cost of the scented oil, but since it’s not an essential oil blend, I wouldn’t do anything but throw it out anyway. I think there are much better choices out there.",0,positive

"I ordered this cargo mat not knowing if it would be as good as a factory install or Weathertech. I've ordered both before and they have been excellent, however, this time I didn't want to pay the premium. Both were close to $200. For the price, this is an excellent choice. Of course, it is a DIY solution so any buyer should have some design and cutting skills. I made a paper template of my cargo area and traced it with a pencil around all the edges. Then I cut it exactly with a sharp razor knife. I then transferred the template onto the mat and traced the mat with a sharpie. By cutting all edges with the same sharp knife I was able to make a precise outline of my cargo area. It fits perfectly and I saved $160!",0,positive

As a veteran myself I want to display something in honor of my brothers and sisters in arms. This is a small gesture but I goes a long way to those who see it. This is the second flag that I have bought not because there was something wrong with the first one but because I needed another one for my new car.

"Our toddlers (20 months and 3.5 years old) love this garage.  I was looking for something ""simple"" without too many buttons and noise, also something easily storable, and something with levers/ things to pull, etc.  This little garage hits all the high notes on all of the above.  Our kids play with this non-stop.  It's fairly small, so easy to leave on a shelf.  And it has these cute moving parts, like a car wash, with a moving platform and other details, the gas pump, the car elevator, etc.  Just enough to keep kids entertained, and not too much to wind them up.

"I'm really uncertain if this did anything. I'm trying to remove cigarette smoke from a van with leather seats. I bought two of these to cover the area. I first did a different car bomb that was scented, so upon starting these, the van didn't smell of smoke but of the scent of the other bomb.<br />The directions say to saturate the sponge, so I got it dripping wet and didn't wring out. (Directions also say you can put white pouch in a cup of water rather than using the sponge.) I left them in the van for about 16 hours, aired it out for about 3 hours before I finally got to smell it. The smell is still the scent of the previous bomb, not of the chlorine gas that this makes. However, I do know the chlorine gas is being released, as my trash is now overwhelmingly bleach smell.<br /><br />Now about 6 hours after airing it out, I still smell a hint of smoke on the leather chairs if I get close. But the main smell is the other scented car bomb.<br /><br />Also note on my photo, the instructions show &#34;mildew odor control&#34; but the packaging was as shown on amazon &#34;auto odor eliminator&#34;.",3,negative

"I toiled for days over whether or not I should get this Fuel Pump. My dilemma was the fact that there were three potential pump categories available for my 2000 Silverado. First was a pump that was under fifty, then there was a pump in the neighborhood of two hundred, then there was this pump, right around a hundred.<br /><br />After going back and forth, and considering the mileage on my truck, over 200k, I finally decided to just go for the middle pump.<br /><br />I can't say how this pump compares to the other two pumps mentioned because I haven't used those, but I can say that this pump does its job perfectly and was a breeze to install. As soon as this pump was installed, it turned the key on and waited for the pump to go silent, then a bump of the key and the truck was back in service.<br /><br />Two tips:<br />First, have some lube ready for applying to the side surfaces of the pump to aid in inserting into the tank. I had it about halfway installed before I realized that it wasn't going to make it. I removed the pump with a little difficulty, then used a light coat of Vaseline which worked perfectly in allowing the pump to easily slide in.<br /><br />Second, be very careful when disconnecting the fuel lines. The lines are under pressure and when you are in a very precarious position under the bed of the truck trying to disconnect the lines, I found out the hard way that when the line detaches, the pressure is instantly relieved. In my case, it was followed by about 10 minutes of eye flushing.<br /><br />Over all; great pump, easy installation, and comes with everything you need to do the job.<br /><br />Oh yeah, last tip; do searches on methods of replacing the pump. I chose the bed tilt method and couldn't have been more pleased at the ease of this method. Dropping the tank was not for me. My wife and I were able to tilt my bed up easily and place blocks for bracing.",9,positive

"I bought two of these as there was a $5.00 discount on each, plus I wanted one in each vehicle. My first experience with these portable air compressors was with the AirHawkPro Max. It performed in a jam a couple of times, saving us money and time. But, recently, too recently to be honest— the thing lasted less than a year— the air compressor stopped blowing air. I was able to purchase two of these for the price of one of the AirHawks.<br /><br />I tried both of them immediately upon receiving and the both started right up once plugging them into the cigarette lighter. Once plugged in, the blue LED came on and the rest is simple step by step instructions. Set the PSI you desire (32) for my vehicle tires, attach the Schrader nose and hit the start button. Depending on how much PSI is needed the machine shuts off when it reaches your desired setting. I was impressed with the continuity across all four tires that needed a good deal of pressure. I was afraid it would ultimately overheat and shut down. Not the case. Each tire filled up with precision and no overheating.",9,positive

They are too short for using full roller rockers....they barely stick out a few threads above the rocker trunion.....not enough to engage more than 3-5 threads into the poly lock that holds the rocker to the stud...I found that out the hard way cuz  the tip of the stud was inside the polly lock still when it broke off while driving my chevy big block powered c10 truck home from work yesterday......I had to use a drill to get the piece out of the polly lock....lucky it didn't fall through the drain back hole in the head and bounce around in the valley area or fall through to the oil pan or wreak any other havoc in the engine.....I will say that it was pretty stout and it took almost 500 miles to finally break off....and the motor has seen a couple of runs to 5500 rpms.....I imagine that if I had the stock type rocker arms or even a set of roller tip stamped steel rockers they would hold up just fine.....I would recommend them if that were the case.....I should have known better than to use them for my roller rockers.....but other wise they would have worked just fine....they were priced very reasonable.....it was my fault that the one failed....I ended up ordering some ARP rocker studs becuz they are about a half inch longer than the old ones I was using giving the polly locks much more thread to grip onto....,4,negative

"We live in southern Arizona and don't deal with a lot of ice and snow, but we do get a little from time to time. While it's not enough to make us scrape every day, we still need a scraper at the ready during winter, just in case. That said, this was a great find because we needed one for each car, and they can be taken apart and stowed away in a handy storage pouch. I didn't realize this was a feature when I bought them, so I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package and saw two drawstring pouches in the box with the scrapers and brushes. So far, it's a good buy, but of course, my widow hasn't iced over since ordering, so I will have to come back and let you know how it performed after I am able to put it to the real test.",3,positive

It took a couple applications (and some elbow grease) but it did an AMAZING job on the scratches. Each application made the marks less and less noticeable.

"One of the things I don’t like about this container is the fact that there is no way to stiffen the sides to keep it square and open.

Unlike the rest of the container. . . there is cardboard in the lid.  It would be nice if the lid turned-down in the front so that it actually closes. . .

Appeared to be OEM replacement.  Had to modify a bracket slightly and loosen up some bolts and drill a mounting hole out just a little bigger in order to get everything to line up.

"These hangtags measure 3” x 5”. They are made of what I can only assume is card stock. The color is quite bold. Fairly easy to read, except for the valid from and to boxes which are quite small. They are blank on the back.<br /><br />At the top of each hangtag it shows to hang on rearview mirror facing outward. Oddly enough, one of the listing pictures shows it facing inward.<br /><br />These hangtags show that they are being sold by a Canadian company. I do not show where the tags were made, but they are wrapped in sewing thread, which is very odd. I can only assume that they are probably made in China. That being the case, at the current price of fifty bucks, they are super crazy over-the-top outrageously overpriced. Ten bucks would be more appropriate.",3,positive
"Arrived with NO mounting hardware. Those four bolts are sold SEPERATELY for $30.99. Following the link to see if $31 would even get stainless. No. ""High quality metal."" WHAT? Higher quality than the stainless steel that it needs to be and should be?? I cannot install my wife's rack without those cheap, 200x marked up bolts. Also funny is that the ""Backrest"" portion of her ""Luggage Rack and Backrest"" is ""not sold seperately"" and yet we dont have one. SCHEMES! In contrast, the SUPER-cheap $53 sissy-bar for MY Harley also arrived (a month early)... Everything I need is there and I'm loving it. Some people just aim to DIG those dollars out of you while others sell products. I am here to warn you - these are bad people and you likely won't get what you were hoping for (and certainly at the price). I'm not asking them to make it right because look... pay attention... you can see there ill intentions and if they should read this, I would only imagine there sorry souls laughing at us.",0,negative
"We all know how motorcycle batteries are.  You can’t trust them.  I already had a NOCO battery jumper and plug that’s attached to the battery.  I bought this to tender the battery and I just plug it in on the same plug that I use for the jumper.  If your battery is DEAD DEAD this charger will bring it back to life and once it’s done charging, it turns into a trickle charger.  Awesome buy!",5,positive

@ 60 psi this gauge read 55.1 55.3 & 55.3 [3 different reads] compared with 3 other more expensive digital gauges that read 60.1 60.16 & 60 psi. that is almost 10% innacuracy. NOT GOOD!,5,positive
"Unfortunately, it doesn't exactly fit most of the gauges on my condensers.  I bought this to improve the air flow of my window air conditioner units.  Probably not really the fault of the product.  I'd lay more blame on the A/C Mfg.  A decently made product for a difficult job.",8,positive

Product comes with two seat covers. Printed camo side seems reasonable/good for the price. Backside/underneath has the classic foamy/flimsy padding and the stretchy bands with hooks to secure to spots under the seat. Product fit my Tacoma V6 4x4 factory seats.

Update 10/17/18 - I just installed my third Denso (this time in another Camry I bought) and it went in just perfect. And I did add the clamp to the overflow tube again just in case. The two others I bought are still going strong. Very happy with these!<br />Original - This is the second Denso I've purchased. Both were perfect fits. Took off one star because both leaked at overfill tube connection and required a clamp. Stiil very happy. Saved a good deal of money and both are working great.,9,positive

"I have always hated the way that indent behind the door handle gets all scratched up from gaudy rings and things you shouldn't be holding while trying to open the door. I'm always careful about how I 'handle the handle'. But, many people are not.<br /><br />Selecting these inserts was a natural decision. They looked good in the listing and were priced right. Like so many other trim accessories, they are held on with 3M tape. The placement was easy. They pretty much align themselves with the indent. Only one issue that I see. They do not fit flush to the indent. This allows water to get behind them. This could be problematic for vehicles that are left outside in freezing weather. I don't know that this would cause them to come off. But, it seems likely. Winter is approaching. So, if I have any problems, I will come back and update my review. But, for now, they get four stars.",0,positive

"This is a direct drop in replacement for a DRZ-400S.  Bike sat for about a week, covered in snow, and started right up!  Given that DRZ's tend to eat batteries, for the price this is a great alternative to the stock battery.<br /><br />**Edit**  Two years later, it's been a cold past week, close to zero degrees in the mornings when I leave for work, and my DRZ turned over every time I started it.  Maybe I got lucky, but this battery far surpassed the stock DRZ battery.  I highly recommend it for anyone with a DRZ running the stock battery.  The main complaint with the stock battery is that it never reliably started my bike in the cold.  Mine was sold by Amazon in case there are other sellers.<br /><br />**Edit** Four years later, the battery is still working very well.",5,positive

I pulled the air reservoir apart on the shocks I purchased and it is a sealed chamber with no passage to the shock itself so you are basically filling a sealed chamber with air and it has zero effect on the shock.

"Works well on our car and bike tires. It's a little slow and quite noisy, but it's good to have on hand. I would have given five stars if -- 1 - it had a quick-release chuck (it comes with a screw-end chuck which ALWAYS loses air when disconnecting.) 2 - it had a storage container for the extra inflator ends (they're small and easily lost.) 3 - the pressure gauge was more accurate (mine is off by about three pounds)",8,positive
"Using this for mounting a smartphone at the helm of a sailboat. It clamps perfectly to 1&#34; rail. I wrap the rail with a little rigging tape but only to reduce the clamping force needed.

Much better than charger that comes with most 24 volts things. It is important to know that there really is no manual control of this however. Manual charges at around 28 or 30 volts while automatic charges at 24 or 26ish. Not exact numbers but manual is a more agressive charge. All the buttons on the charger are nothing more that indicator lights. While it's display is only viewable at like a 30 degree arc. It is very informative. Shows you either what it is charging at or if not connected to power will actually show you what charge the battery has. While it was a little different than what I thought I purchased it did work. It was able to charge batteries in a fraction of the time of normal chargers. However connected to a 12 volt gel and once to lead acid it did get the batteries extremely hot. I have had this happen with other chargers. But I would not just leave batteries charging for long periods of time I would set alarms to check on them.,5,negative

"Don't let the photo fool you, this is a fairly small and basic compressor that's slightly bigger than a large flashlight.  However, the size is not really a factor in its performance, as it manages to fill the air in my car tires just fine - just about the same rate as something at the gas station.  There's a digital display that's backlit which would be useful in the absence of light.  Operation is fairly straightforward and it comes in a nice bag with assorted accessories (the zipper popped off but easy to reattach).  What I appreciate the most is the nice feet and base that allows you to let it sit on the floor securely.  My other compressor dances around the floor and often falls over, but these have nice feet that keep the compressor in one place.  Great to keep in the car or for your garage.",8,positive

"Best wiper blades on the market period. Bought the 21"" and the 19"" for my 2005 Honda Civic EX Coupe. They are a perfect fit.

By the way, I used this website to determine which sizes I needed for my car make and year - [...]<br />Be aware that Amazon's automatic ""Check Fit"" option is INCORRECT at least for my vehicle.

"These won't keep you warm for cold weather riding, but they definitely cut the wind off your ears on those cold nights with a gladiator style lid (or any half helmet) like I wear. That's right!

Somewhere in between. Thin enough they're not hot and sweaty in the summer as a helmet liner should be. Helps getting your lid on and off fairly easy without pulling your hair out in the process. Looks good and hides that nasty lookin' matted helmet hair you have up there too. If you sweat, no one will know the difference when you pull your helmet off. You'll look good and it'll dry out in the wind walking around pretty quickly. Throw it in the washing machine when you get home on delicate cycle (ask your ol' lady) and line dry it.

"Terrible LED lifetime, terrible corrosion resistance, terrible product.<br /><br />I installed two pairs of the 36W 6.5&#34; flood lights onto the rear bumper of my truck less than 11 months ago, and I have not accumulated more than 10 minutes of use out of them.  Two of the four assemblies have one burned out LED each.  One of which failed to the point where it blackened the reflector in the housing and it looks terrible.  I disassembled it to see if i could clean it with isopropyl alcohol, and it would not come off at all.  LEDs should not fail this early.<br /><br />All four of the aluminum housings have oxidized very badly.  The paint is bubbling up and there is chalky corrosion coming from underneath.  These lights saw salted roads maybe 5 times since being installed last fall.<br /><br />I hope I still have the original bolts to put back in the bumper because I will be taking these lights off and buying a better product elsewhere.",9,negative

I had a near miss thanks to these terrible pads, fortunately there was no traffic in the on-coming lane so I was able to use it to avoid a collision. I replaced these inferior pads with Akebono where are great. Don't put your life at risk with Satisfied brake pads.",6,positive

"This product is over priced at $7.95.  The quality of the material is lower end.  The suction cups are small in size, which means less reliable time.  You can keep your old pass holders, and continue to use them.  The size misMatch is ok.  Maybe later, this company will reduce their prices to a more reasonable $ 4.95  (then, and only then, will this be four stars or five stars. )",0,positive

"HID is the past, LED is now.  All halogen folks need to make the jump to LED now.  As simple as you can get to install.  Just like replacing the light bulb... no other HID style wiring needed.  I have a 2011 Mustang, and the new lights are great, and they dont blind others on the road.  If you want to keep your stock halogen headlight but upgrade the bulb to a more modern technology, this is what you need to buy.<br /><br />** If the beam pattern seems a little off, or you cant align them to look normal, you have an indexing problem.  Mine was caused by not completely tightening the driver side bulb. Due to the millions of headlight designs your bulbs may need to be rotated (indexed) using a simple process that tech support can advise you about.  Give support about 2 business days to respond if using email. **",2,positive

Great value. I’m constantly tinkering with things and lose/break cotter pins. These came in handy as it’s not easy to go to a hardware store for 1 cotter pin. It’s nice to have plenty available.,1,positive

Back saver. This was easy to install. VStar 950 tourer. Once you choose the hight of the backrest there is no adjustments. The steel bends back and forth. Sometimes I have to pull on it to get it back to where I want it. Overall for the price it is good. I would buy it again. I used it for a long trip and I am very glad I had it.,0,negative

Bought for my 78 cj5. The fit is great.,2,positive
"Install took 5 minutes, the assist works well.  There is an install issue.  The tailgate support cable gets pinched between piston and sidewall.  My solution was a very slight bend in top cable clip which lets the cable go outside(towards the passenger side) of the piston (no binding or rubbing)",9,positive

"Edit 11/21/20: Amazon sells a great endoscope made by Destech for about 35 bucks. Be sure to buy one if you buy this Camco. I got mine yesterday and used it today to fish the Camco's tube out of my RV's tank fill line.<br /><br />[Original review] Notice that the only thing holding the clear plastic tube onto the base is friction, and we're talking smooth plastic on smooth plastic. There is no barb or anything else. About the 4th time I used it, the water pressure shot the plastic tube off into my RV. It's now stuck somewhere inside the inlet line or fresh water tank, I hope it never causes a problem. If you think you need this, I'd suggest putting a tiny stainless steel screw through the hose into the base. Or at least rough up the yellow part and add a hose clamp.",9,positive

These are great towels for cleaning almost anything but especially for your car.  They are super soft and absorb a ton of water after a good car wash.  This will leave a streak-free shine ready for a coat of sealant.,3,positive

I've already used it twice and felt very safe and secure, feeling that my vehicle was securely-raised and held. Definitely a good buy for those looking for a reliable car jack.",6,positive
Seems like a solid built product but both zerk fittings were busted off inside. Had to remove what was left of them with a pick was hoping seller could send me replacement zerks as they are an odd size not 1/4 like normal.,1,positive

"I installed this just above the storage compartment on my Coleman Lantern 17B camper. These campers are infamous for rain running down the side and it somehow gets through the door hinge and into the camper storage. I know that most people just install gutter spouts on their camper and I will at some point but for now, this stops the water from running down onto the storage door. To be honest, this redirects the water about 2 inches to the sides of the storage door. This is a cheap win-win for me!",0,positive
like the oem one but not worn out. went in like it was supposed to if you do this yourself be prepared for some  creativity  it requires you to unbolt the rear end remove the rear strut just unbolt one side and use a prybar and man handle the rear end and you will have this bad boy  installed since its installed on top of the rear axle anyways. ride is way  better.  slapped that ball joint  bolt on with a impact  BBBB RRAAAAAAAPPPPPPP done Didn't need the allen key hole. BTW the one you get is the one in the second picture not the first. The second bottom picture is proper on a 05  sebring sedan. quality seems better than orginal. i probbaly will outlast the car since the car has 181k and rusted worse than a chevy.. BTW it is way cheaper to buy this from another place  but cant beat the  2 day or one day shipping,9,positive

"The fins bend easy(that's a given), but other than that I think it works well. Cant/didn't measure temps, but the underside near the trans definitely feels a TON cooler, so I can only assume it lowered temps quite a bit. Installed on a 98 Impreza auto, and install was a breeze. No leaks and all the hardware included did the job.",1,positive

2008-2010 escapes and mariners are notorious for having the rear latch fail thereby not allowing you to use the rear portion of the vehicle other than thru the rear glass. When my sons failed I could not see him paying the $400-$500 that the service shops at Ford dealers are charging. We ordered this aftermarket replacement and watched a video on YouTube and were able to do it ourselves in less than an hour (leisurely pace) and for less than $30 saving hundreds. The only warning I would give is to make sure you have a tigth fitting head when removing the screws as they are held with Loktite blue and will strip if you don't.,9,positive

"Holy cow, am I impressed by these gloves so far. I ordered these for my 11yo son in size XXS (XX-Small) and they are a great fit. He and I (an adult woman) have almost the same sized hands, though I would have ordered the XS for myself.<br />I am also impressed with the quality of these gloves. We live in Northern Wisconsin and it is COLD here. Below freezing up to eight months of the year here..... and my kids walk to school daily; plus recess and other normal kid things. And after feeling and seeing these gloves in person, I'm can say these seem perfect for freezing cold temps.<br />These gloves have a soft, thick fleece lining on the inside. Plus the outer material looks very durable and feels flexible. These gloves feel thick and well insulated too. I expect that these will keeps his hands very warm. Plus the black color is nice since it hides dirt  well. Overall, I can't find one negative thing to say about this pair of gloves. If I loose one, I'm almost certain I would come back to buy another pair..... These gloves really were a great find. My son will give this pair plenty of use, so I'll be back with an update if I am wrong!<br />Hope this review was helpful.",8,positive

"Tried everything, eventually had to buy some gasket material and stack rubber with original rubber to make them water tight , also had to seal outer edges of the lights with clear silicone to prevent moisture, tried contacting the seller through Amazon to no avail,  beware ,hopefully you don't have the issue I had , tried to resolve it without leaving a review but I haven't heard a word about refund or warranty, not even sure I can get one after all the work I did trying to fix them ,Also the passenger side molding was to big to fit perfect, had to use a tigerpaw on my grinder to shave it down some to fit uhh",0,positive
